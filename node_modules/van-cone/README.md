# Van Cone
### An SPA framework add on for VanJS

ðŸ”¥ **Van Cone plus VanJS can create a fully featured SPA app that minifies and gzips to less than 3.5 kB!** ðŸ”¥

This lightweight (less than 250 lines) VanJS addon adds the following features:
- Navigation powered by custom router with async loading
    - integrates with browser history
    - state object integrates with browser history
    - url and query param parsing
- `navLink` component for generating links based off of named routes
    - easily add url and query params
    - active class css styling

# Overview

ðŸš¨ **Van Cone is in Beta - API changes are possible** ðŸš¨

Van Cone is a minimal framework that provides routing, history and a link component that provides dynamic styling for when it is the active link.

There is only one exported function which is used to create an application object. You provide it with the DOM element that will contain the app, a list of routes, and an optional default state for `window.history.state` and it returns an object with several SPA helper methods.

Install:
```bash
npm install van-cone
```
A basic hello world app requires javascript and HTML:

Example JS:
```javascript
import createCone from 'van-cone';
import van from 'vanjs-core';
const { div, p, span, hr } = van.tags;

// define page components
const homePage = () => div('Home Page')
const userPage = (params) => div('User Page', p('userId: ' + params.userId))

// define routes
const routes = [
  { path: '/',              name: 'home', callable: async () => homePage },
  { path: '/user/:userId',  name: 'user', callable: async () => userPage }
];

// create the spa object
const routerElement = div({ id: 'layout' })
const { navLink } = createCone(routerElement, routes)

// main app layout
const App = () =>
  div(
    navLink({ name: 'home' }, 'Home'),
    span(' | '),
    navLink({name: 'user', params: {userId: 123}}, 'User'),
    hr(),
    routerElement
  );

document.body.replaceChildren(App());
```

Example HTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="description" content="Dialog Modal component with VanJS" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>VanJS Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="./src/index.js" type="module"></script>
  </body>
</html>

```
